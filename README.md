# Task Management App

## Overview
This is a simple **Task Management Application** written in Python. It allows users to **add, update, delete, and view tasks** in an interactive menu-based system.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- View all tasks
- Exit the program safely

## How It Works
1. The user enters the number of initial tasks.

   - **1**: Add a task
   - **2**: Update a task
   - **3**: Delete a task
   - **4**: View all tasks
   - **5**: Exit the program
3. The program runs continuously in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
